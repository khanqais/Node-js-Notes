About:
 {readFilesync,writeFileSync}=require('fs');

This line of code uses destructuring assignment to import two specific functions, readFileSync and writeFileSync, from the fs (file system) module in Node.js.

readFileSync: Reads the contents of a file synchronously (blocking). It returns the file data.
writeFileSync: Writes data to a file synchronously (blocking). It creates the file if it doesnâ€™t exist or overwrites it if it does.
Here's what's happening:

require('fs'): Imports the built-in Node.js fs module, which provides file system functionalities.
{ readFileSync, writeFileSync }: Destructures the fs object to extract these two specific methods instead of importing the whole module.
This syntax allows you to use readFileSync and writeFileSync directly, without needing to reference fs.readFileSync or fs.writeFileSync each time.

asynchronous processing can provide higher performance and better efficiency, especially in environments
